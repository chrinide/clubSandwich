\footnote{Working in a panel data setting, \citet{Hansen2007asymptotic} and \citet{Donald2007inference} identified conditions under which cluster-robust test statistics converge to a limiting $t$-distribution as the number of measurement occasions increases, holding the number of independent units fixed.}

We further assume that $\left(\bm{U}'\bm{U} - \bm{U}_i'\bm{U}_i\right)$ is of full rank for $i = 1,...,m$.

(However, \citet{Cameron2015practitioners} note that the correction factor used in Stata is sensitive to how the model is estimated, because it is a function of the dimension of the covariate matrix.)

In the $q = 1$ case, the standard is therefore to instead use the t-distribution instead, with degrees of freedom $m - 1$ when CR1 is employed.
Similarly, when $q > 1$, this results in the test $F = Q/q$, which is compared to the $F(q, m - 1)$ reference distribution.
\todo{Is this really standard?} 

By moving to the t and F-distributions, the CR1 corrections greatly improve the performance of these Wald-type tests in small samples.
However, these corrections alone are not adequate, since - like the bias adjustment - the degrees of freedom do not account adequately for features of the covariates that affect performance of the statistics.
Cameron and Miller highlight this problem, noting that the BRL approach provides an alternative method for estimating the degrees of freedom using a Satterthwaite approximation. 
This method has been widely tested and shown to perform well; we review the method and findings in the next sub-section.
Importantly, however, no such small-sample approach has been developed for multi-parameter hypothesist tests. 
In the sub-section that follows, we develop such a test.
Our approach is similar to a Satterthwaite approximation, in that it involves approximating the distribution of $Q$ using an $F$ distribution with estimated degrees of freedom. 

In this section, we review extant work on small-sample corrections for single-parameter hypothesis tests (i.e., t-tests), following which we propose a small-sample correction for multiple-parameter tests (i.e., F-tests).

In addition to the Satterthwaite approximation, two other promising methods for testing single-constraint hypotheses have been proposed. \citet{McCaffrey2006improved} described a saddlepoint approximation to the distribution of $Z$, providing simulation evidence that a test based on a this approximation offers even more accurate rejection rates than the Satterthwaite approximation. 
A further method is to use a bootstrap re-sampling technique that provides small-sample refinements in the test rejection rates.
\citet{Cameron2008bootstrap} studied several such bootstrapping techniques. 
\citet{Webb2013wild} describe a wild boostrap procedure that performs well even when $m$ is quite small and when clusters are of unequal size.  

\cite{Pan2002small} proposed to choose $\eta$ to minimize the squared differences between the covariances among the entries of $\eta \bs\Omega$ and the covariances of the Wishart distribution with $\eta$ degrees of freedom and scale matrix $\bm{C}\bm{V}^{CR}\bm{C}'$. 
\citet{Zhang2012MANOVA} instead matches the mean and total variance of $\bm{C}\bm{V}^{CR}\bm{C}'$ (i.e., the sum of the variances of its entries), which avoids the need to calculate any covariances. 


\section{DISTRIBUTION THEORY FOR $\bm{V}^{CR}$}
\label{app:VCR_dist}

The small-sample approximations for t-tests and F-tests both involve the distribution of the entries of $\bm{V}^{CR2}$. This appendix explains the relevant distribution theory.

% First, note that any of the CR estimators can be written in the form $\bm{V}^{CR2} = \sum_{i=1}^M \bm{P}_i \bm{e}_i \bm{e}_i' \bm{P}_i'$ for $r \times n_i$ matrices $\bm{P}_i = \bm{M_{\ddot{R}}} \bm{\ddot{R}}_i' \bm{W}_i \bm{A}_i$.
% Let $\bm{c}_1,\bm{c}_2,\bm{c}_3,\bm{c}_4$ be fixed, $p \times 1$ vectors and consider the linear combination $\bm{c}_1' \bm{V}^{CR2} \bm{c}_2$. 
% \citet[Theorem 4]{Bell2002bias} show that the linear combination is a quadratic form in $\bm{y}$: \[
% \bm{c}_1' \bm{V}^{CR2} \bm{c}_2 = \bm{y}'\left(\sum_{i=1}^m \bm{p}_{2j} \bm{p}_{1j}'\right) \bm{y}, \]
% for $N \times 1$ vectors $\bm{p}_{sh} = \left(\bm{I} - \bm{H_X}\right)_h' \bm{P}_h' \bm{c}_s$, $s = 1,...,4$, and $h = 1,...,m$. 

Standard results regarding quadratic forms can be used to derive the moments of the linear combination \citep[e.g.,][Sec. 13.5]{Searle2006matrix}. We now assume that $\bs\epsilon_1,...,\bs\epsilon_m$ are multivariate normal with zero mean and variance $\bs\Sigma$. It follows that 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CRVE_expectation}
\E\left(\bm{c}_1' \bm{V}^{CR2} \bm{c}_2\right) &= \sum_{i=1}^m \bm{p}_{1j}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{2j} \\
\label{eq:CRVE_variance}
\Var\left(\bm{c}_1' \bm{V}^{CR2} \bm{c}_2\right) &= \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^m \left(\bm{p}_{1i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{2j}\right)^2 + \bm{p}_{1i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{1j} \bm{p}_{2i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{2j} \\
\label{eq:CRVE_covariance}
\Cov\left(\bm{c}_1' \bm{V}^{CR2} \bm{c}_2, \bm{c}_3' \bm{V}^{CR} \bm{c}_4\right) &= \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^m \bm{p}_{1i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{4j} \bm{p}_{2i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{3j} + \bm{p}_{1i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{3j} \bm{p}_{2i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{4j}.
\end{align}
Furthermore, the distribution of $\bm{c}_1' \bm{V}^{CR2} \bm{c}_2$ can be expressed as a weighted sum of $\chi^2_1$ distributions \citep{mathai1992quadratic}, with weights given by the eigen-values of the $m \times m$ matrix with $\left(i,j\right)^{th}$ entry $\bm{p}_{1i}' \bs\Sigma \bm{p}_{2j}$, $i,i=1,...,m$.
