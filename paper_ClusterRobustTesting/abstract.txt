Cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) is commonly used to account for heteroskedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors in regression models with unobserved effects. Although asymptotically consist, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with overly liberal rejection rates. One solution is to use bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with t-tests with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a variety of scenarios, we find that conventional cluster-robust Wald tests can severely under-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error close to nominal levels.
