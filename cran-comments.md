## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. 

Note that the DESCRIPTION file includes a citation to Bell and McCaffrey (2002), but unfortunately that article does not have a DOI; I have included a URL instead.

## Test environments

* local Windows 7 Enterprise, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2, devel
* win-builder (release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
